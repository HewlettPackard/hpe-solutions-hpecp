# These three variables get variables at runtime from the host file
server_profile_name: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname].name }}"
server_hardware: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
server_hardware_type: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname].type }}"

# The value of these variables is derived from the firmware names that the server hardware understands.
# User is not expected to change these values.
# In case the "validate_firmware_version.yml" fails due to the name mismatch then user can compare the values of these variables from "server_firmware_details.json" file
# "server_firmware_details.json" is generated by the playbook "deploy_server_profile.yml" under the roles directory "deploy_server_profile/files"
